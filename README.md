# JGrade

_A library for grading Java assignments_

This is a fork of [tkutcher/JGrade](https://github.com/tkutcher/jgrade),
created by Tim Kutcher. Because he has moved on to other projects, I
forked it so I could run it with the current (2022) version of Gradescope.
I have made minor changes to the JGrade library and significant changes
to the [Gradescope example](examples/gradescope/README.md). See
[my changes](https://github.com/tkutcher/jgrade/compare/tkutcher:jgrade:dev...espertus:jgrade:dev).

**This has been superseded by [Jacquard](https://github.com/espertus/jacquard).**
