NOTE - I've moved the CI to GitLab and am using GitLab to host the API docs (https://tkutcher.gitlab.io/jgrade), but this
will remain the primary repository. GitLab will just mirror the master and dev branches.


:bangbang: Help Wanted :bangbang:

Once upon a time, it was my priority to be grading intermediate-level Java 8 assignments - but after graduating that
priority has gone down a bit :grimacing: . I would be happy to help familiarize anyone who is interested in contributing
and keeping this maintained. Submit an issue in the project if you are interested or have any ideas!

## Overview
JGrade is a helper tool with various classes designed to assist in course instructors "autograding" an assignment, 
inspired by the [Gradescope Autograder](https://gradescope-autograders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). There are classes 
that the client can integrate with directly, or use the jar's main method (and provide a class with annotations) that 
wraps a lot of common functionality (see [examples](https://github.com/tkutcher/jgrade/tree/development/examples)). 
It was designed to produce the output needed for Gradescope while being extensible enough to produce different 
outputs and configure the specific JSON output Gradescope is looking for.


## Quick Start

To make use of this, you first need to grab the jar file from the [Releases](https://github.com/tkutcher/jgrade/releases) page.
This includes many classes you can make use of, as well as a main method for running and producing grading output.

With this, you could have the following setup:

A class that runs some unit tests we want to treat their success as a grade (these would import student code):

```java
import com.github.tkutcher.jgrade.gradedtest.GradedTest;
import org.junit.Test;

import static com.github.tkutcher.jgrade.gradedtest.GradedTestResult.HIDDEN;
import static com.github.tkutcher.jgrade.gradedtest.GradedTestResult.VISIBLE;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertFalse;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue;
import static org.junit.Assert.fail;

public class ExampleGradedTests {
    @Test
    @GradedTest(name="True is true", points=2.0, visibility=VISIBLE)
    public void trueIsTrue() {
        assertTrue(true);
    }

    @Test
    @GradedTest(name="False is false", number="2", points=3.0, visibility=HIDDEN)
    public void falseIsFalse() {
        assertFalse(false);
    }

    @Test
    @GradedTest(name="Captures output")
    public void capturesOutput() {
        System.out.println("hello");
    }

    @Test
    @GradedTest(name="This test should fail")
    public void badTest() {
        fail();
    }
}
```

and a main method with some other grading-related non-unit-testing logic `MyGrader.java`:

```java
import com.github.tkutcher.jgrade.BeforeGrading;
import com.github.tkutcher.jgrade.AfterGrading;
import com.github.tkutcher.jgrade.Grade;
import com.github.tkutcher.jgrade.Grader;
import com.github.tkutcher.jgrade.gradedtest.GradedTestResult;

import static com.github.tkutcher.jgrade.gradedtest.GradedTestResult.HIDDEN;


public class BasicGraderExample {

    /* All @Grade/@BeforeGrading/@AfterGrading methods must take exactly one parameter
     * of type Grader. This parameter is the same grader throughout.
     *
     * @BeforeGrading methods are run before others.
     */
    @BeforeGrading
    public void initGrader(Grader grader) {
        grader.startTimer();
    }

    /* You can run unit tests that are annotated with @GradedTest to add
     * GradedTestResults to the Grader in this way.
     */
    @Grade
    public void runGradedUnitTests(Grader grader) {
        grader.runJUnitGradedTests(ExampleGradedTests.class);
    }

    /* You can also manually add GradedTestResults you create to the grader. */
    @Grade
    public void singleTestResult(Grader grader) {
        grader.addGradedTestResult(
                new GradedTestResult("manual test", "1", 1.0, HIDDEN)
        );
    }

    /* Grader.startTimer() and Grader.stopTimer() can be used to time the grader */
    @Grade
    public void loopForTime(Grader grader) {
        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        while (System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime < 1000);
    }

    /* @AfterGrading methods are run after all other methods. */
    @AfterGrading
    public void endGrader(Grader grader) {
        grader.stopTimer();
    }
}
```

Then, you could run 

```shell script
java -jar ../lib/jgrade-1.1-all.jar -c MyGrader -o results.json
```

and get GradeScope-formatted json. See the [examples](/examples) for more complete examples and how to set up a script
to work with GradeScope, and expand the usage below to see the arguments you can provide this main program.

<details><summary>Usage</summary>
<p>

```
-c,--classname arg            the class containing annotated methods to grade
-f,--format output-format     specify output, one of 'json' (default) or 'txt'
-h,--help<br>
   --no-output                don't produce any output (if user overriding)
-o destination                save output to another file (if not specified,
                              prints to standard out)
   --pretty-print             pretty-print output (when format is json)
-v,--version

```

## Features and Usage

The way I used this library is to have a base class for the course (for example, a `_226Grader`) that contains 
annotated methods for functionality/grading parts that are consistent across all assignments. For example, the 
`@BeforeGrading` method starts a timer and the `@AfterGrading` method stops it. There is a `@Grade` method that 
does the "grading" of style with checkstyle. Subclasses, for example `Assignment1Grader` (or `Assignment0Grader`
 I suppose :wink:), extend this and add  `@Grade` methods to add assignment-specific grading. 
See the gradescope folder in the examples for a rough example setup.

### Features

See the [API Docs](https://tkutcher.gitlab.io/jgrade/api) for more complete documentation.

#### `CheckstyleGrader`

With the `CheckstyleGrader` you can specify grading deductions for checkstyle errors. This method below, for example,
would check the students files and deduct a point for each checkstyle error type (missing javadoc, require this, etc.).
 
```java
    @Grade
    public void runCheckstyle(Grader grader) {
        CheckstyleGrader checker = new CheckstyleGrader(5.0, 1.0, MY_CHECKSTYLE_JAR, STUDENTFILES);
        checker.setConfig(MY_CHECKSTYLE_CONFIG);
        GradedTestResult result = checker.runForGradedTestResult();
        result.setScore(Math.max(0, 5 - checker.getErrorTypeCount()));
        grader.addGradedTestResult(result);
    }
```

#### `DeductiveGraderStrategy`

You can use this strategy to make failed tests deduct points from a total. So say in the current assignment there are two
parts, A and B, each worth 25 points. If someone fails 30 tests for part B each worth one point, you don't want that to cut
in to the assignment A portion:

```java
public class GradeAssignment7 extends Grade226Assignment {
    
    private static final int AVL_POINTS = 30;
    private static final int TREAP_POINTS = 20;

    @Grade
    public void gradeAvlTree(Grader grader) {
        grader.setGraderStrategy(new DeductiveGraderStrategy(AVL_POINTS, "AvlTreeMap"));
        grader.runJUnitGradedTests(GradeAvlTreeMap.class);
    }

    @Grade
    public void gradeBinaryHeapPQ(Grader grader) {
        grader.setGraderStrategy(new DeductiveGraderStrategy(TREAP_POINTS, "TreapMap"));
        grader.runJUnitGradedTests(GradeTreapMap.class);
    }
}
```

#### `CLITester`

A class to help wrap testing command line programs. You subclass `CLITester`, then implement
the `getInvocation()` method for how the command line program is invoked, then you can use
`runCommand(String)` to get the output in an object that you can test for expected output.

### Requirements
JGrade is written in [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html). 
Since the library has classes designed to run alongside JUnit, [JUnit 4](https://junit.org/junit4/) is a dependency 
for the entire project (as opposed to just for running the projects own unit tests). 
The [org.json](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json) package is used in producing correctly formatted 
JSON output, and the [Apache Commons CLI](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-cli/) library is used for 
reading the command line in the main program.

For simplicity, the main jar (appended with "-all") includes all of these dependencies.

### Wishlist
- Feedback for required files
  - In our autograder, we built in something that took a list of required files and created a visible test case worth 0 points of what files were missing - this helped students debug.
  - Could try and move some of this there.
- Actual Observer pattern
  - Allow for people to specify custom handlers whenever things like new graded test results are added
  - Old "observer" terminology not really an observer
